- Why have you decided to hold the Ruby courses?

There are a lot of open education programs nowadays. They appear in different minds,
countries, universities. There are many online courses, videos and non-certificate-
granting programs, including edX, MITx, Harvardx, Coursera, Udacity... And I'm glad that every
participant of our course finished at least few of them. But offline learning is much more effective: 
you listen coach right next to you, able to ask him a question, interact with other students.

- What format do you held the courses in?

It's the second iteration of the course in Kiev and we changed a lot from the first one.
The are not only lections and homework assignments now, we added lot of practice in class. 
We meet two times a week. It is usually one lection, one practice, lot of
homework and home reading.

- Is there a lot of visitors? And are they mostly skilled Ruby developers who wants to
improve their knowledge or people who just get acquainted with it?

More than we expect :) 40 people in the group, approximately 30 people on every lesson
plus 5 coaches. 
The course was designed for web developers who are willing to programme on Ruby and use Ruby on
Rails. Most of students are web developers who want to learn Ruby, but there are some
skilled Ruby developers too.

- Do you plan to hold the seminars on a regulary basis? How often?

Yes. We plan to making seminars once in a two week. There are lot of topics that we want
to share, developers who finished the course and nerds  who just passionate in Ruby, programming. 
They all want to keep moving...

- What are you plan for the future of the course? What about creating the own Ruby school? 

Is this a suggestion? :) Besides the knowledge it's lot of positive emotions that course
gives to everybody. But it's lots of work too. 

- Thank you!

You're welcome.
